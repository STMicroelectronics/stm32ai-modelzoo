# Network includes files
This directory will contain the includes files for the C-model of your image classification CNN model.

It will be filled by the [deploy.py](../../../../../image_classification/deployment/deploy.py) script. A [README](../../../../../image_classification/deployment/README.md) explains how to use it.
