# Network includes files
This directory will contain the includes files for the C-model of your object detection CNN model.

It will be filled by the [deploy.py](../../../../../object_detection/deployment/deploy.py) script. A [README](../../../../../object_detection/deployment/README.md) explains how to use it.
